Working on:
 - calculateControls
 - Porting to pixhawk
 - Test effect of unknown inertias, mass, CG, output changes on responses.
 - Investigate effect of gyroscopic loads.
 - Investigate effect of aerodynamic loads. 

Issues/Improvements to working code:
 - Get improved thrust model from Matt / calculate it yourself. 
 - Double check inertiaTriPrism

====================================================

calculateControls
 - put betweenPi in a function
 - put pwmLimits in a function
